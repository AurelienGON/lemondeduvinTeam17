The 2004 has the highest ever percentage of Cabernet (90%) in the final blend - usually it\'s around 80% - and is one which Director Frédéric Engerer likens to their astonishing 1996. The nose is dense and intense with deep black fruits yet without clumsiness or over extraction - just defined, cool and precise. The palate is powerful and majestic with its sweet raspberries and licorice following through to an indecently long finish.

Displaying fabulous density, an inky purple color and a superb nose of forest floor with a hint of menthol as well as loads of creme de cassis, mocha and touches of chocolate and subtle oak, this full-bodied, deep, concentrated wine represents only 45% of the estate\'s production. It is certainly not for those who can\'t wait a few years for it to round into shape, as I suspect it needs at least 5-8 years of bottle-age, but it should last for half a century or more. A stunning wine from Rauzan Segla, kudos go to administrator John Kolasa for turning out this profound wine, which should prove to be a timeless classic from the appellation of Margaux.\"\r\n95+\r\nRobert Parker, Wine Advocate (205), March 2013\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful clarity of fruit with raspberries and currants on the nose.

The results in the glass are intense and glossy, full of satin-textured apricot and white peach flavours. There are exotic fruits of pineapple and mango but winemaker Sandrine Garbay has kept a focus on fresher flavours of lime zest and citrus that balance out the natural richness and concentration.

This wine also possesses lots of elegance and finesse. The wine\'s medium gold color is accompanied by an exceptionally sweet nose of honeyed tropical fruits, peaches, coconut, and apricots. High quality, subtle toasty oak is well-integrated. The wine is massive on the palate, with layers of intensely ripe botrytis-tinged, exceptionally sweet fruit. Surprisingly well-integrated acidity, and a seamless, full-bodied power and richness have created a wine of remarkable harmony and purity. Certainly it is one of the richest Yquems I have ever tasted, with 50-100 years of potential longevity. An awesome Yquem!

The palate is well balanced and crisp, with a fine line of acidity and a touch of stem ginger and orange peel toward the finish.

('Rosé Wine', 11, 2020, 'Château d\'Esclans Garrus Rosé 2020', 959, 'ABV 13.5%\r\n\r\nPrevious vintage 2019 review-\r\n\r\n\"Garrus is always awesome and, every so often, it is completely unpredictable.  The 2019s from Château d’Esclans are sublime and Garrus ought to be the most obviously masculine and imposing in the portfolio but, strangely, I felt that the perfume and the initial attack was positively gentle and come-hither in its composure and allure.  So, I did what any right-minded person would do and relaxed into another sip.  I then realised that I had been tricked!  Garrus is as structured and proud as ever and yet it is sporting a kindly disguise to lull you into a false sense of security.  Many will drink this wine too early, fooled by the glossiness and initial enchantment on offer.  But they will soon realise that this wine’s finish is firm and unyielding, pointing to a long and graceful life – as long as you have the patience.  This is a sensational vintage for Garrus and I rate it as highly as the epic 2015 and that means that this is a perfect 20/20 in my notes.  Nothing comes close in 2019 (apart from its sibling, Les Clans) and I have tasted hundreds of bottles.  The difference between this wine and the 2015 is that the ’15 was very obviously statuesque with amazing flanks and bold musculature.  By contrast, this 2019 is subtle, brooding, complex and intricately perfumed.  The nose is cool and soothing and the palate is a veritable iceberg of power and equilibrium and while we can only sense the scale of grandeur of this wine, the signposts on the surface are already devastatingly attractive.  You simply must buy and keep this wine for at least twelve months before you pop a cork!\"  \r\n\r\n20+/20 Drink 2021 – 2027\r\n\r\nMatthewjukes.com 28/10/2020\r\n\r\nGarrus from chateau d\'Esclans was first produced in 2006 and has already received praise from some of the World\'s most respected wine critics (see below).
